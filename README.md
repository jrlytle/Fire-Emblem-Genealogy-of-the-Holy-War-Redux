# Fire-Emblem-Genealogy-of-the-Holy-War-Redux
An update for the Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War released on the SNES in 1996. Original game developed by Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo. Graphics pulled from Fire Emblem: Awakening, released in 2012 and will be pulled from Fire Emblem: Fates, set to release in 2016. Disclaimer: I do not own Fire Emblem or any of the graphics (custom or otherwise) pulled from the games. This project is only for fun, and to see if it's possible to transfer to modern day graphics.
